# About

## The software
REACT is a modern molecular sciences software package primarily aimed at relative energy calculations with quantum 
mechanical (QM) / density functional theory (DFT). The software offers its users a new way of managing computational
projects in a structured manner with great flexibility and efficiency. REACT is designed in an intuitive way to keep 
track of the many different geometry-, input- and output-files generated for every stationary point from a given 
reaction pathway. The increase in computational power witnessed over the last decades has made it possible to include 
increasingly larger parts of enzymes in DFT calculations, more commonly known as cluster models. However, creating 
cluster models is not straight forward and typically very time consuming and prone to human errors. By including open 
source Pymol in REACT, the user can with only a few clicks prepare a protein cluster model at any desired size ready 
for DFT calculations. Efficient analysis of results is enabled through automatic relative energy calculations with 
options to include typical correctional terms for solvation, dispersion and/or vibrations. Results can be graphically 
represented through modern plotting functionalities including energy diagrams, self-consistent field convergence plots 
and frequency IR spectrum plots. REACT connects all its project files to open source Pymol where not only stationary 
points can be visualized, but also animations of vibrations from frequency calculations and intermediate geometries 
from optimization calculations.
